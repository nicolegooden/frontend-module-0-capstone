### Pseudocode:

This program's goal is for the user to pass in a random string, along with an integer representing the number of positions each letter in the string should shift.  

This program requires OOP.

1. Create a class called `class CaesarCipher {}`.

1. Within the class, declare a method called `encode() {}`.

1. Below the class, introduce `var cipher = new CaesarCipher()`.

1. Create a variable `var alphabetPositions` with an assigned array containing each of the 26 letters of the alphabet, as the string data type.

1. Shift the position of each array item
